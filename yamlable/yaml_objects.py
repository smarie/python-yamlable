    A helper class to register a class as able to dump instances to yaml and to load them back from yaml.

    This class relies on the `YAMLObject` class provided in pyyaml, and implements the to_yaml/from_yaml methods by
    leveraging the AbstractYamlObject class (__to_yaml_dict__ / __from_yaml_dict__).

    It is basically an extension of YAMLObject
     - mapping the methods to methods in AbstractYamlObject (for consistency with YamlAble) so that you only have to
     provide a mapping to dictionary and do not have to care about pyyaml internals
     - and raising an error if the `yaml_tag` class field is not properly set.

    You still have to
     - define `yaml_tag` either directly or using the @yaml_info() decorator
     - optionally override methods from AbstractYamlObject: __to_yaml_dict__ and __from_yaml_dict__

    Note: since this class extends YAMLObject, it relies on metaclass. You might therefore prefer to extend YamlAble
    instead.
